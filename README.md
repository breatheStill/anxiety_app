## Planning Phase

#### <a id="user-stories">User Stories</a>

* As a person with anxiety, I want an app that give me suggestions to calm myself down.

* As a person who gets stressed, I want an app that I can communicate with other people who struggle with stress and/or anxiety. 

* As a person who is a professional psychologist, I want an app where I can share articles for people with anxiety.

* As a person who has anxiety, I want an app that I can watch stress relieving videos.

##### Developer Stories

* As a developer, I want code that I can easily read and adjust so I can add a feature to this project.

* As a developer, I want an app that has a running database to reduce load time for clients.

* As a developer, I want a code that is dry, so it is less code to siff through.

* As a developer, I want to incorporate APIs so clients can update the database.

#### <a id="conflict-plan">Conflict Plan</a>

1. The opposing parties will sit down with the team for an open discussion on the arguments at hand.
2. If after 20 minutes the issue is not resolved, a pros and cons list, and the team will make  a deciding vote on it.
3. In the condition of a vote tie, the team will find a more senior member of the Code Fellows community and brief them on the issue and require their opinion on the issue. This will be the tie-breaking vote. 

#### <a id="communication">Communication Plan</a>


| Method | Explanation and Purpose  |
|:-----:|---|
| Slack |Our primary source of communication. Check when at Code Fellows.  |
| Phone |Secondary form of communication, to be used when slack has not been checked about important updates.  |
| Email |Tertiary communication method as a backup to Slack and Phones.  |

As a group we will take time and effort to communicate clearly and accuratly our feelings and expectations to avoid potential communication issues.

As a group we will communicate repectfully to each other and we will need to come together when there are issues as to avoid accidental slighting and/or passive aggressive behaviors.

_Jokes on slack must have a **JK** or **LOL** and/or distinguished clearly from the rest of the slack messages._

##### As a group we are expected to be available on **Slack** from 4pm to 9:30pm on class days.

## Documentation
Your project should be documented on GitHub and within your code base.

On GitHub, create a `README.md` file as the main landing document of your repository. Continue to update it as your project evolves. 

_Why:_
> Projects should contain proper documentation so that anyone can visit your repository and understand the purpose of your application.

At a minimum, your `README.md` should include the following:

- Team Name: Anti-anxiety
- Team members
    - Lorin Stewart, 
    - Jessica Elliot, 
    - Andrew Davis, 
    - Erik Johnson 
- Description
